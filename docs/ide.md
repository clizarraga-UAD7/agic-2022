Integrated Development Environments (IDE) are graphical interfaces for working with code and data.

Modern IDEs interact with cloud and cloud native data types. 

:material-microsoft-visual-studio-code: The most popular software development IDE for working with code is Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code). VS Code has extensions for many geospatial applications and can be used to run large compute clusters on cloud.

:fontawesome-solid-q: QGIS is the most popular IDE for open source GIS applications and has native features which allow users to load cloud optimized and analysis ready data.

:material-language-r: RStudio and :material-language-python: Project Jupyter are two other widely used IDE for working with code and data for research. RStudio focuses mostly on the R programming language, but has backward compatibility with Python. Project Jupyter was originally focused on Python but has broad compatibility across almost every programming language.

Free services running virtual machines on the cloud allow you to start and work in your browser. These include Google's Collaboratory (CoLab), the MyBinder Project, GitHub's CodeSpaces, and GitPod.

[RStudio Workbench](https://www.rstudio.com/products/workbench/){target=_blank} -  is an integrated development environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser.

## On-Demand Cloud-based IDE

[CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/){target=_blank} - Google's CoLaboratory starts a Jupyter Notebook, limited in size but can be increased with subscription.                

[CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces){target=_blank} - GitHub's CodeSpaces starts a VS Code instance from a GitHub Repository which can be variabily sized (requires subscription)      

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/){target=_blank} - starts a VS Code instance that can be variably sized 

[MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/){target=_blank} - starts a defined environment (RStudio, Jupyter, VS Code) from a GitHub Repository, limited in size.
